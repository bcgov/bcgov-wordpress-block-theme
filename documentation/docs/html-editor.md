## Classic Editor
When adding new content to a new or existing page you have the option of using the classic editor. It is the traditional WYSIWYG style of editor. This must be added as a block and is not available as an edit option. 
Place the cursor where you would like to insert the classic editor using the enter key. This places an empty paragraph block on the page.

Select the blue Block Inserter icon, top left corner of the screen.

A wide range of text formatting options are available through the editor. Using the HTML step outlined previously, the content can be viewed as HTML.

Multiple editor blocks maybe used on one page, allowing for specific styling and looks for that block.

Any content added with the editor is contained within the Classic block. This allows you to change the position of the editor and its content. All the content of a page can be created within the editor block. 

Deleting the editor block will delete all its content as well.

An editor block and its content can be converted to independent blocks and removing the editor.
