## Enabling images to print

To show an image when printing, or set the width of the image on a printed page, follow these steps:

1. Select the image on which you want to add these settings.
2. In the Block Inspector, click on the "Other media settings" heading.
3. To show the image when printing, check the box next to "Show image when printing".
4. To set the maximum width of the block when printed, enter the desired width value in the "Max width on printed page" field as a % of the printed page width.

By default images do not print. If you have an image that conveys information, such as a graph, and want it to print, you will need to enable this by selecting the  **Image block or the Media & Text block**  (currently the only two blocks supporting printing images).

Using the "Max width on printed page (%)" slider or its related number field will set the percentage an image takes on the printed page. This range can be from 10% to 100% of the printed page width and is set to a default of 25%.

Once you have set these options, you can preview the block to see how it will appear when printed.
