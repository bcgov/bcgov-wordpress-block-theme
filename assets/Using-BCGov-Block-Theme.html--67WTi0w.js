This setting is designed to control the point at which the default mobile hamburger menu transitions to the ribbon navigation. Enter the desired pixel value that you want to use as the new breakpoint. This value represents the screen width at which the mobile menu will switch from the hamburger icon to the ribbon navigation.</p><p>If the initial breakpoint value doesn&#39;t provide the desired user experience, you can return to the &quot;Custom Mobile Menu Breakpoint&quot; setting and make further adjustments until you achieve the desired result.</p><h3 id="google-site-name-optional" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#google-site-name-optional" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Google Site Name (optional)</h3><p><em><strong>Note that for sites using the All-in-one SEO (AIOSEO) plugin, this setting is superfluous and can be left alone.</strong></em></p><p>This setting serves a crucial role in conveying to the Google Search index the preferred name for a website. By default, it aligns with the Site Title specified in the WordPress site settings.

In some circumstances you may only have access to padding or margin but not both. And in other cases the padding and margin option may not be available. It is up to you to use combinations of containing blocks such as groups, rows, columns, etc. to find the right layout pattern for your desired look and feel.</p><p><strong>Warning:</strong> Be careful when using margins and padding in the editor and setting your own sizes. Using explicit sizes â€“ eg: 2rem, 1.5em or 18px â€“ are one size fits all (or doesnâ€™t fit as the case may be). Any padding or margin spacing added to any element, layout, pattern or block is going to display similarly across all resolutions. 6rem of margin on a desktop view may look good, but can add a lot of unwanted spacing on mobile devices.</p><h3 id="fluid-typography" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fluid-typography" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Fluid Typography</h3><img src="'+p+'" align="right" height="125"><p>This feature enables font sizes to adapt to changes in screen size, for example, by growing larger as the viewport width increases, or smaller as it decreases.
