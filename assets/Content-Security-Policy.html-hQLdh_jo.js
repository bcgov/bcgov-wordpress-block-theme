CSPs work by specifying which types of content can be loaded and executed on a website, and from which sources they can be loaded. This can help prevent malicious scripts from running on your website, as well as reduce the risk of data theft and other types of attacks.</p><h2 id="how-to-identify-what-exception-is-needed-for-a-custom-security-policy-exception" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-identify-what-exception-is-needed-for-a-custom-security-policy-exception" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How to Identify What Exception is Needed for a Custom Security Policy Exception</h2><p>If you need to add a Custom Security Policy Exception, follow these steps to identify what exception is needed:</p><ol><li>Determine which specific resources or elements on your website are being blocked by the CSP.
