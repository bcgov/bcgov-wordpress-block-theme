It is up to you to use combinations of containing blocks such as groups, rows, columns, etc. to find the right layout pattern for your desired look and feel.</p><p><strong>Warning:</strong> Be careful when using margins and padding in the editor and setting your own sizes. Using explicit sizes â€“ eg: 2rem, 1.5em or 18px â€“ are one size fits all (or doesnâ€™t fit as the case may be). Any padding or margin spacing added to any element, layout, pattern or block is going to display similarly across all resolutions. 6rem of margin on a desktop view may look good, but can add a lot of unwanted spacing on mobile devices.</p><h3 id="fluid-typography" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fluid-typography"><span>Fluid Typography</span></a></h3><img src="'+u+'" align="right" height="125"><p>This feature enables font sizes to adapt to changes in screen size, for example, by growing larger as the viewport width increases, or smaller as it decreases.
